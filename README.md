## Abstract
A rapid phantom transition of the dark energy equation of state parameter <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w"> at a transition redshift <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z_t<0.1"> of the form <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(z)=-1%2B\Delta w \Theta (z_t-z)"> with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta w<0"> can lead to a higher value of the Hubble constant while closely mimicking a Planck18/Î›CDM form of the comoving distance  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r(z)=\int_0^z\frac{dz'}{H(z')}"> for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z>z_t">. Such a transition however would imply a significantly lower value of the SnIa absolute magnitude <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M"> than the value <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M_C"> imposed by local Cepheid calibrators at <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z<0.01">. Thus, in order to resolve the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H_0"> tension it would need to be accompanied by a similar transition in the value of the SnIa absolute magnitude <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M"> as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M(z)=M_C%2B\Delta M \Theta (z-z_t)"> with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta M<0">. This is a Late <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w-M"> phantom transition (LwMPT). It may be achieved by a sudden reduction of the value of the normalized effective Newton constant <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu=G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}"> by about 6% assuming that the absolute luminosity of SnIa is proportional to the Chandrasekhar mass which varies as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G_{\rm eff}^{-3/2}">. We demonstrate that such an ultra low <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z"> abrupt feature of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w-M"> provides a better fit to cosmological data compared to smooth late time deformations of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H(z)"> that also address the Hubble tension. For <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z_t=0.02"> we find <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta w\simeq -4">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta M \simeq -0.1">. This model also addresses the growth tension due to the predicted lower value of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu"> at <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z>z_t">. A prior of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta w=0"> (no <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w"> transition) can still resolve the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H_0"> tension with a larger amplitude <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M"> transition with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta M\simeq -0.2"> at <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z_t\simeq 0.01">. This implies a larger reduction of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu"> for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z>0.01"> (about 12%). The LwMPT can be generically induced by a scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity with no need of a screening mechanism since in this model <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu=1"> at <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z<0.01">.
